# Description
User Permissions mixin. Makes querying for permissions easier. Firefox and Safari haven't implemented the query api, so this mostly provides a way around that. Firefox and Safari don't support selecting a different output though.

# Usage
```vue
    Import the mixin into the Vue Component
    mixins: [UserPermissions]
    Call in the function that you need. Returns a promise.
    UserPermissions.methods.getUserPermissions()
    or
    UserPermissions.methods.requestUserPermissions('audio') // or video
```
