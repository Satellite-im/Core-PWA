# Running

## Environment

It's important to setup your environment before running `Core-PWA`. This will require you
to add some keys. See the `.env.example` file to get started.

Start by copying the `.env.example` to a `.env` file. This stores secure information and is not pushed to production.

```
cp .env.example .env
```

Currently, the only environment variable you need is comma separated list of sync nodes, `NUXT_ENV_IRIDIUM_SYNC_NODES`.

## Running Locally

To start running locally complete the Environment setup and then:

Run the linkscript - this will build iridium and let you install it:

- Allow execution and run `chmod +x linkscript.sh && ./linkscript.sh`
- Install dependencies `yarn`
- Run hot reload/dev version `yarn dev`

## Running Cypress tests

To run Cypress tests you need to do `yarn dev` in order to build out `localhost:3000`, that's the one we use as the baseUrl

You also need to go to the iridium repo and run `pnpm i`, `pnpm build` and `pnpm sync-node`

When `localhost:3000` is running you can either use

- `npx cypress open` - this will open the test runner and you can test all the tests in bulk or run a specific test

or

- `npx cypress run --browser chrome` - this will run the tests in the terminal

if you want to run a specific test on terminal you can also use

- `npx cypress run --spec "cypress/e2e/test-name-here.js" --browser chrome`

## Running Jest tests

To run Jest tests you can use

- `yarn test` - this will run all the tests on our test suite

if you want to run a specific test you can also use

- `yarn test folder-name/test-name-here.test.ts`

## Building Desktop Apps

You have to go through the normal install process/linkscript process to get iridium installed as a package.

Then:

- `yarn generate`
- `yarn tauri build`
